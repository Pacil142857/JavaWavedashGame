# WaveJump

This is a simple platforming game with wavedashing made in Java (though it's more like a proof-of-concept). The main gimmick is that you can jump out of a wavedash, and doing this keeps the extra momentum from wavedashing. Currently, the game is complete, though more can definitely be added.

If you want to use the name WaveJump for your own GitHub project, message me.

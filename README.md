# WaveJump

This is meant to be a simple platforming game with wavedashing made in Java. The main gimmick is that you can jump out of a wavedash, and doing this keeps the extra momentum from wavedashing. It's pretty much complete, but there's a lot more that can be added. This more like a proof-of-concept than anything. It should work if you run it in the directory it's in, but if it doesn't, message me.
